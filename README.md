# Identicon
Generate a unique 250x250 image based on a string (weell it makes identicons).
Just a small annoted and documented project to play with Elixir and become familiar with it's syntax.
Not hoping anyone but me to love it.
## Usage

```elixir
iex -S mix
iex> Identicon.main("banana")
```
And your file is now stored as ```./banana.png```.

## Generate the docs

```elixir
mix docs
```
And the doc is now available at ```./doc/index.html```.
